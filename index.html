  <p>
    Currently a 9-5 Digital Marketer that specializes in Pay-per-click Advertising<br>
     I love helping businesses acquire more customers, make more money to create more impact<br>
     BUT I also love to illustrate, design & code in my free time<br>
     Hence the start of this website...<br>
     I know it doesnt look too impressive right now, but as I continue to learn, I promise to update my website along the way<br>
     Let's see how far this takes us:3
